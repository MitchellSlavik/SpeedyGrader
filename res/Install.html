			This instruction manual is for using SpeedyGrader on a windows machine.<br>
			All other operating systems are untested and I am leaving it up to you<br>
			to figure it out if you choose to use this software on anything other<br>
			than windows. >:D

		<p>
		Before starting these steps make sure typing "javac -version" in a<br>
		command prompt <b>does not</b> give any version information or doing<br>
		this will be pointless.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		You obviously already have the java JRE installed on your computer just<br>
		to read this manual, but to use SpeedyGrader to grade java programs you<br>
		must have the java JDK installed to your computer as well. You can find<br>
		the link for the JDK at the bottom of this page. Just click on the <br>
		"Java Platform (JDK)" and download/install it.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		After it is installed, you must set your classpath on your computer to<br>
		point to the newly installed JDK. To do this you navigate to your<br>
		"Advanced System Settings", click "Environmental Variables...", then<br>
		click "edit" with your System Variable "Path" selected. Now go find the<br>
		path to the bin folder of the JDK (It should look something like <br>
		"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk#.#.#_##\bin"). Append that path to your <br>
		"Path" System Variable (Windows 7 and earlier, add a ';' before<br>
		appending the JDK bin path).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		If everything went OK then you should be able to open a command prompt,<br>
		type "javac -version" and get version output. Congrats you are now<br>
		set to go to use SpeedyGrader for grading java programs.<br> 
		<b>SpeedyGrader will require a restart to work after following these steps.</b>

		<h1>C++</h1>
		<div style="padding-left: 5px;">
			<p>
			Before starting these steps make sure typing "g++ --version" in a<br>
			command prompt <b>does not</b> give any version information or doing<br>
			this will be pointless.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			To start grading C++ files with SpeedyGrader, you must first install<br>
			MinGW. Download MinGW from the link at the bottom of this page. After<br>
			opening the installer, click "Install". Make a note of the installation<br>
			directory (Usually "C:\MinGW"), then click "Continue". Wait for the<br>
			installations to finish downloading and installing.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			After the MinGW installer finishes, it should open a new window that<br>
			allows you the choose MinGW packages. Click the checkbox next the<br>
			package that ends in "g++". Then go to the top and select<br>
			"Installation > Apply changes". Another window will appear, hit<br>
			"Apply". Wait for more downloads/installations to complete. After<br>
			the installations are complete, close the "MinGW Installation Manager"<br>
			window.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			After it is installed, you must set your classpath on your computer to<br>
			point to the newly installed MinGW bin. To do this you navigate to your<br>
			"Advanced System Settings", click "Environmental Variables...", then<br>
			click "edit" with your System Variable "Path" selected. Now go find the<br>
			path that MinGW installed to and get the path of the bin folder <br>
			(It should look something like "C:\MinGW\bin"). Append that path to your<br>
			"Path" System Variable (Windows 7 and earlier, add a ';' before <br>
			appending the MinGW bin path).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			If everything went OK then you should be able to open a command prompt,<br>
			type "g++ --version" and get version output. Congrats you are now set to<br>
			go to use SpeedyGrader for grading C++ programs.<br>
